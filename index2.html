    <h1>Therexa</h1>
    
    <p>I do not know what I may appear to the world,</p>
    <p>but to myself,</p>
    <p>I seem to have been only like a child playing on the sea-shore,</p> 
    <p>and diverting myself in now and then</p> 
    <p>finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary,</p> 
    <p>whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.‚Äù</p> 
    <p>-- quote borrowed from Sir Issac Newton</p>
